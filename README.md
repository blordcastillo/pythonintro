# Introductory Geoprocessing with Python  

This course has undergone a significant rewrite.  
The original material is still contained in [coursematerial.html](coursematerial.html).  
Now, you should start with []installing Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) and using the [Course Overview Notebook](Course%20Overview.ipynb).
