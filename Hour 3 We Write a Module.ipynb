    "# We Write a Module\n",
    "(Based on the [Modules tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html))  \n",
    "  \n",
    "You already used a text editor early to make a .py file. This is commonly called a \"script\" when composed of just one file, but can you also break out reusable pieces of code into multiple files.  \n",
    "This decomposition of code makes for easier code maintenance, encourages code reuse, and allows you to add structure to your programs. Python allows you to put definitions in a file and use those definitions in another script or in the interactive interpreter; these files are called modules and you access them with the ```import``` statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Namespace\n",
    "Each module has a namespace. If the module is being run directly as a script, this is always ```__main__```, but when imported to another module, the name reflects the file name and is stored in a global (module level) variable called ```__name```.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## The Fibonacci numbers module  \n",
    "Instead of using the interactive interpreter in the notebook, it is time to break out IDLE and create a file. (You could do this in a text editor, but creating the file in IDLE will make it easier to import your module.)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Put this code into your file. It defines two functions, both of which will be in the global namespace of the module.    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    while b < n:\n",
    "        print b,\n",
    "        a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "\n",
    "def fib2(n): # return Fibonacci series up to n\n",
    "    result = []\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    while b < n:\n",
    "        result.append(b)\n",
    "        a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "Save the file as fibo.py.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now switch the Python interpreter and import this module and test your commands.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import fibo\n",
    ">>> fibo.fib(1000)\n",
    ">>> fibo.fib2(100)\n",
    ">>> fibo.__name__\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that you have to use the namespace to access these functions. If you are going to access the function repeatedly, you can assign the function to a local name.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> fib = fibo.fib\n",
    ">>> fib(500)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or you can import the function from the module namespace into the global namespace.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from fibo import fib\n",
    ">>> fib(500)\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also import all the functions in the module into the global namespace!  \n",
    "(There is a special exception where ```from x import *``` skips functions whose names start with an underscore (```_```))  \n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from fibo import *\n",
    ">>> fib(500)\n",
    ">>> fib2(50)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And there's your first module!  \n",
    "  \n",
    "A module can contain executable statements as well as function definitions. These statements are normally intended to initialize the module and are only executed once when the module is first imported. Even if you import the module a second time, the statements will not be executed again.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Any variables defined in those statements go into the module namespace and symbol table. This let's a module written by one author operate without colliding with variables defined by the user! (But you can still get to those variables using the ```namespace.attribute``` notation.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can import other modules, and frequently do. Coding style dictates that you put all imports of other modules at the top of your module, but it is not mandatory to do that.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Modules as scripts\n",
    "When you run a Python module with\n",
    "```\n",
    "python fibo.py <arguments>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the __name__ set to \"__main__\". That means that by adding this code at the end of your module:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    import sys\n",
    "    fib(int(sys.argv[1]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "you can make the file usable as a script as well as an importable module, because the code that parses the command line only runs if the module is executed as the “main” file.  \n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python fibo.py 50  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "If the module is imported, the code is not run:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import fibo  \n",
    ">>>  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often used either to provide a convenient user interface to a module, or for testing purposes (running the module as a script executes a test suite).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Searching for Modules  \n",
    "When a module is imported, the python interpreter goes through a series of steps to find it.  \n",
    " 1. Search for a built-in module with that name.  \n",
    " 2. Search the directory containing the initial script (or the current directory)  \n",
    " 3. Search the list of directories contained in the environmental variable PYTHONPATH\n",
    "The last two are contained in ```sys.path```. Because they are held there, it is possible for a program to modify sys.path (removing or adding directories) before the search for an import is done.  \n",
